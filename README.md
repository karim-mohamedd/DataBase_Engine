## Overview

This project is a simple Database Management System (DBMS) implemented using Bash scripting. It allows users to create, manage, and manipulate databases and tables directly from the command line. This project aims to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use interface for database operations, making it an ideal learning tool for those interested in shell scripting and basic database management concepts.

## Features

- **Create and Delete Databases**: Users can create new databases or delete existing ones using simple commands.
- **Create and Drop Tables**: Users can define new tables within a database and drop them when no longer needed.
- **Insert, Update, and Delete Records**: Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations can be performed on the tables within a database.
- **Data Retrieval**: Users can run simple queries to retrieve data based on conditions and filters.
- **Data Validation**: Basic data validation checks are performed to ensure the integrity of the data being entered.

## Prerequisites

To run this DBMS, you need:
- **Bash Shell**: Make sure your system has the Bash shell installed. This DBMS is tested on Bash version 4.0 and above.
- **Permissions**: The script requires permissions to read, write, and execute files. Make sure to run it with appropriate permissions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karim-mohamedd/DataBase_Engine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DataBase_Engine
   ```

3. Make the main script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x DataBase_Engine
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   cd Software
   ./DataBase.sh
   ```


## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
DataBase_Engine/
│
├── Software/              # Contains All the Scripts
├── DATA/           # Directory where databases and tables are stored
└── examples/            # Example usage and sample databases
```

## Limitations

- This DBMS is intended for learning and demonstration purposes and may not be suitable for production use.
- The script does not support complex queries or indexing.
- No encryption is provided for database files, so use it with caution for sensitive data.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more complex queries and joins.
- Implement a user authentication mechanism for access control.
- Improve data validation and error handling mechanisms.
- Add support for logging operations for auditing purposes.
